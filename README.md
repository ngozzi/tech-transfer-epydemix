#  Insight Net Tech Transfer Workshop, 28-29 January, 2026 (Chapel Hill, NC)
This repository contains all the materials (code, data, and instructions) for the 28-29 January, 2026 Insight Net Tech Transfer Workshop focused on epydemix.


## Workshop Objectives

This two-day hands-on workshop introduces [Epydemix](https://github.com/epistorm/epydemix), an open-source platform for stochastic epidemic modeling, simulation, and forecasting. You'll gain both theoretical foundations and practical skills across Epydemix's interfaces: simulation dashboards, Python package, R integration, and forecasting tools.

### What You'll Learn

**Theory**
- Stochastic epidemic processes and chain-binomial models
- Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) for model calibration
- Principles of epidemic forecasting with mechanistic models

**Hands-On Skills**
- Install and use the Epydemix Python package and R interface
- Implement ABC calibrations, retrospective analyses, and forecasting pipelines
- Explore intervention strategies and visualize epidemic trajectories

**Tools & Applications**
- Design and run epidemic models (SIR, SEIR, etc.) using the dashboard with country-specific population data and age-stratified contact matrices
- Forecasting application for real-time predictions
- Performance assessment dashboard for evaluating model accuracy

By the end, you'll be equipped to incorporate Epydemix into research and operational settings with reproducible, cross-platform workflows.
